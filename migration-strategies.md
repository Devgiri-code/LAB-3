# Migration Strategies

This document outlines the proposed migration strategies for each component of the company's on-premises infrastructure. The goal is to move to cloud services, leveraging the best of PaaS, IaaS, and SaaS offerings.

## Web Application Migration

- **Service Type**: PaaS (Azure App Services or AWS Elastic Beanstalk)
- **Reason**: PaaS simplifies infrastructure management, automates scaling, and allows the development team to focus on building the application instead of managing servers.
- **Approach**: Rehost the monolithic web application into a PaaS solution with minimal code changes (Lift and Shift).

## Database Migration

- **Service Type**: PaaS (Azure SQL Database or Amazon RDS)
- **Reason**: Managed databases provide automatic backups, patching, and scaling, reducing the burden on the IT team.
- **Approach**: Transition to a managed database service, while maintaining control of database schemas and structure. A hybrid approach (PaaS with IaaS) can be used temporarily during migration.

 **File Storage Migration**

- **Service Type**: PaaS (Azure Blob Storage or AWS S3)
- **Reason**: Cloud-based file storage offers scalability, redundancy, and cost-effectiveness. It eliminates the need for local hardware.
- **Approach**: Migrate the file system to cloud storage, with access integrated into the web application and database.

** Networking Migration**

- **Service Type**: Cloud-native Networking (Azure Virtual Network or AWS VPC)
- **Reason**: Cloud-native networking provides a secure, scalable, and configurable infrastructure with load balancing, traffic control, and security groups.
- **Approach**: Recreate the companyâ€™s current networking setup using cloud-native solutions, ensuring secure communication between services.

 **Email Service Migration**

- **Service Type**: SaaS (SendGrid, AWS SES)
- **Reason**: SaaS-based email services reduce management overhead, integrate with web applications, and provide advanced features like analytics and automatic scaling.
- **Approach**: Move email notifications to a SaaS provider for simplified setup and management.

 **Migration Plan**

| Component             | Service Type     | Migration Strategy                 | Timeline    |
|-----------------------|------------------|------------------------------------|-------------|
| Web Application        | PaaS             | Lift and Shift to Azure App Services or AWS Elastic Beanstalk | Week 1-2    |
| SQL Server Database    | PaaS/IaaS        | Transition to Azure SQL or AWS RDS | Week 3-4    |
| File Storage           | PaaS             | Migrate to Azure Blob Storage or AWS S3 | Week 4-5    |
| Networking             | Cloud-native     | Adopt Azure VNet or AWS VPC        | Week 5-6    |
| Email Services         | SaaS             | Migrate to SendGrid or AWS SES     | Week 6-7    |
